## What's Included ##
This section of the Blackbaud-CRM-Conferences repo contains code samples from the 2016 Blackbaud CRM Developers Conference.  

**SQL Optimization Essentials**
This session covered the common pitfalls that developers encounter when writing queries for SQL Server. It covers what you need to know as a Blackbaud CRM developer, and discusses real performance issue examples and resolutions. Youâ€™ll learn:
 - What kinds of statements prevent indexes from being used
 - How parameter sniffing can make or break query performance
 - The benefits and tradeoffs of query restructuring techniques such as dynamic SQL and temporary tables 

**UAT Kit Hands-on Experience**
This interactive session demonstrated how to automate user acceptance testing with the UAT Kit and provided hands-on experience.

**Develop and Extend the Blackbaud Data Warehouse**
This session discussed the general architecture, deployment, and extensibility of the Blackbaud Data Warehouse (BBDW). It used a client-inspired example to demonstrate how to add new objects to the warehouse, create new ETL to populate those objects, and use the SDK to create features from BBDW.

**Create an Inclusive Web Experience in Blackbaud Internet Solutions**
This session shared how to create a stellar user experience in Blackbaud Internet Solutions. It reviewed considerations such as thoughtfulness in design, all users and possible outcomes, and designing for users and their settings instead of the browser. 

**Custom Form Development**
This client-led session explored FSU Foundation's development of custom forms for Blackbaud Internet Solutions.

**Workflows**
This client-led session reviewed how the Jewish Federation of Clevelend used the SDK to facilitate its workflows.  

**Wrap the Web API with a Custom Web Service**
This client-led session explored how the University of Michigan wrapped the Web API with a custom web service.
