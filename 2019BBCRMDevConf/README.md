### Building an Administrator's Toolkit in Blackbaud CRM (Not Yet Available) ###
Dan Bourg, Director of CRM Services, World Wildlife Fund 
Fernando Sotelo, Lead Programmer, World Wildlife Fund 
Rich Muniz, Vice President, BrightVine

World Wildlife Fund® wanted to create a toolkit that provides a single point of administration rather than having to manage items desperately throughout the system on individual processes. The Administrative Toolkit provides a single point of entry to monitor jobs and performance metrics. It includes performance management dashboards that allow administrators to pinpoint long-running queries, long-running batch commit processes, user activity, and more. In addition, it allows tasks using Blackbaud CRM Interactions to be created for business process failures so that they can be managed by the assigned team member.

### Blackbaud Internet Solutions™ University Planning Calendar ###
Dan Keck, Web Application Developer, The Ohio State University 
Thomas Lee, Senior Systems Analyst, The Ohio State University 

The University Planning Calendar is a custom Blackbaud Internet Solutions user interface to the Blackbaud Enterprise CRM event system. Find out how we used JavaScript, display parts, and a custom handler (ASHX file) to fulfill a request from our Advancement Events office to allow non-Blackbaud Enterprise CRM users to view and submit events. University employees can add, edit, copy, export, and search for event records, as well as display events in multiple calendar views similar to Microsoft Outlook® and Google Calendar®. 

### Blackbaud Data Warehouse Tables and QlikView Reporting Customization ###
Sophie Elefther, Associate Director, Systems Management and Data Analysis, Boston College

By extending the out-of-box Blackbaud CRM Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Data Warehouse tables, we built custom reporting tables to standardize all of our outbound reporting data needs. These custom tables have simplified our reporting and are used for many of our integrations with third-party vendors like RNL, EverTrue, and Salesforce® Marketing Cloud. Lastly, using these custom Data Warehouse tables, we built a powerful yet simple and easy-to-use reporting tool (using Qlikview but embedded directly in the Blackbaud CRM application) for easy user access to create lists. This session will include a demonstration of the tool and how we planned and designed it.

### Data Integrities and Data Audits—The Path to the Best Data Possible with Minimal Programming ###
Allen Roth, Director of Business Applications, Jewish Federation of Cleveland 

Data governance and stewardship (i.e., keeping the quality and integrity of your data the best it can be) should be paramount for everyone in every application. In this session, we will review the differences between data rules, data integrities, and data audits. And we’ll show you how to implement an effective, proven solution in Blackbaud CRM with minimal programming. This overview and these practical examples will spark your creativity and help you turn your data quality dreams into reality. 

## Partner Presentations ##

### Using Cognitive Services and Machine Learning to Empower Your Fundraising ###
Chris Kahrs, Cloud Solutions Architect, US AI/ML Partner Lead, Microsoft 
David Hendershot, Principal Software Engineer, Blackbaud

In this co-presentation, Microsoft and Blackbaud will demonstrate how to implement AI into your applications. We will demo a variety of cognitive services and discuss how to create your own machine learning model. Then, we will show these services implemented inside the Blackbaud application.
