# Getting Started With bbui-angular

It is highly recommended that you use [SKY UX](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/) as a front-end framework if you are building an Angular application. SKY UX is built on top of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). All examples on this site will be using SKY UX.

The bbui-angular library wraps up calls to the Infinity webshell and ui modeling services into Angular services. It is fully compatible with Infinity webshell versions 3.0 and up.

## Why use Angular?

The Infinity webshell provides a rich UI and platform that allows complete customization. It is very comprehensive and can do almost anything. However, it is built on top of ExtJS, which is not a responsive framework, so it is difficult to make the existing web UI look good. Also, some of your users may not need the full Infinity experience - if there is a small piece of functionality they need to use, they probably don't want to see the entire webshell and all of the features it has to offer.

With Angular, you can create a single-page application that looks updated and pretty, and is responsive so looks good on all devices.

## Installation

Download the bbui-angular source code via [Bower](http://bower.io/).
