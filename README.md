## Blackbaud CRM Conferences for Developers ##
The Blackbaud-CRM-Conferences repo contains presentations and code samples from the Blackbaud CRM Developers Conferences.

The developer conferences bring together SDK users to share best practices, exchange ideas, build relationships, and learn from Blackbaud CRM SDK experts. This this repo supports that mission by providing access to presentation materials from the conferences.

Third-party contributions are how we keep the code samples great. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that show others how to do cool things with Blackbaud SDKs and APIs. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow.
