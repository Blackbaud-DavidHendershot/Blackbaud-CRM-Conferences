## What's Included ##
The repo contains code samples from the 2014 Blackbaud CRM Developers Conference held in Dallas, Texas on March 10 and 11.  

**Search List Using Data Warehouse Code Sample**

- A [search list code sample](https://github.com/blackbaud-community/Blackbaud-CRM-Conferences/tree/master/2014BBCRMDevConfDallas/SneakPeek) that leverages the Blackbaud Data Warehouse to conduct a custom constituent search. 

**Delivering Information without Reports**

- This [code sample](https://github.com/blackbaud-community/Blackbaud-CRM-Conferences/tree/master/2014BBCRMDevConfDallas/SDKReportingAndAnalysis) contains examples of reports and other ways of delivering information to users. It currently contains two samples:
	- Sustained Giving Dashboard - Shows how to use UI widgets and the Blackbaud Data Warehouse to build a custom dashboard page
	- Top Donors Report - Shows how to build a custom report against the Blackbaud Data Warehouse that leverages a UI model for its parameter form

**List Builder Against the Data Warehouse Code Samples**


- A series of List Builder [code samples](https://github.com/blackbaud-community/Blackbaud-CRM-Conferences/tree/master/2014BBCRMDevConfDallas/OttingerListBuilderDemo) that query the revenue fact table and constituent dimension to provide a fast, flexible report-like feature.
