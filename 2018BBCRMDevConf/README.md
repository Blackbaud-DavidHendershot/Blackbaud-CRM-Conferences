## Customer Showcases ##
The customer showcases showcased current and future ***Blackbaud CRM*** customizations built by customers. They provided an opportunity to learn from peers as they shared their tips, best practices, and results.

### Application User Ownership Reassignment by Repurposing Constituent Merge  ###
Allen Roth - Director of Business Applications, Jewish Federation of Cleveland

The constituent merge functionality is a very powerful framework that can be used for other record types and purposes. This session will cover a case study that replicates this process for the application user record type. It allows administrators to create one or more configurations and is extendable, just like the constituent merge process. When running, the process will either ignore, reassign, delete, or null out the application user on the objects as configured and allowed by the object type.

### Beyond Word-merge: Creating a custom gift receipt process ###
Rob Downs - Director of DAR Information Services
Nate Parker - Team Lead, CRM Development
Jenny Yoo - CRM Developer
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)

After struggling with the limitations of maintaining dynamic content through Word-merge, we created a donor-centric receipt that serves a dual role of an IRS-compliant gift receipt as well as an initial acknowledgement letter. Through a custom SSRS report and the use of the out-of-the-box receipt processes, we were able to streamline receipt review and proofing by our stewardship office while also allowing for dynamic receipt content through a custom content management interface that serves offline and online gifts. 

### Blackbaud Data Warehouse: Reporting and Analytics ###
Tanweer Alam - Interim Director of Advancement Intelligence, University of Illinois Foundation (UIF)

The session will cover the Blackbaud Data Warehouse architecture,reporting, and analytical customizations done at our organization. The session includes:
* Extending the out-of-the-box Blackbaud Data Warehouse data structures, as well as reviewing custom data structures
* Deploying reports and query marts in ***Blackbaud CRM***, using theBlackbaud Software Development Kit with the Blackbaud Data Warehouse as the data source
* Building dashboards in Tableau and deploying into ***Blackbaud CRM***

### Using Open Source Libraries to Create Interactive Visualizations within CRM ###
Greg Harmelink - Associate Director of Advancement Services, University of Georgia (UGA)
This session will cover a few different examples of how the University of Georgia is using open source JavaScript libraries to provide interactive visualizations from within ***Blackbaud CRM***. We will be presenting on two timeline visualizations that are used to present constituent and prospect plan information in a dynamic format. If time allows, we will briefly cover how we used a similar strategy to deploy a pivot table and graphing visualization.

### Mobile App and 2-way-Integration for CRM Contacts ###
Toby Weiss - Chief Information Officer, Jews for Jesus

This session will showcase a custom, progressive web app that allows users to manage CRM contacts and track activity via mobile. There is an additional demonstration of a custom integration framework that allows contact adds and updates to sync with the app and ***Blackbaud CRM*** in real time. The framework is expandable to other third-party apps.

### Marketing Effort Custom Export Process and Integration with ExactTarget ###
Ravi Cheemangunta - Programmer Analyst, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
